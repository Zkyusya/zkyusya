<h1>Hi, I'm Zippy! <br/><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zipporah-kyusya/">DevOps/ Data Science</a></h1
<h3> I have rich background in DevOps with experience in using DevOps tools like Git,Github, Docker, Kubernetes, Maven and Jenkins & Github Actions. Im also proficient in GCP and Huawei Cloud. I am mapping this experience into Data Science by building reliable data analytics pipelines (DataOps). I am particularly interested in healthdata and combining this experience to pursuing a career in BioInformatics - to build reliable AI models, to understand how genomic data and advanced analytics can be used in managing chronic diseases like diabetes to detect risks earlier, guide diagnosis, prevent complications, and ultimately offer more personalized treatment plans, improving patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency.    </a></h3
